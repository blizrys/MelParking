            However, data from the <a href='https://auspost.com.au/postcode/'>Melbourne Open-Data website<a>
            subdivide the city into 17 postcode areas. These postcodes are mainly used for identifying locations
            in the official document or transaction includes delivery. The reason why the postcode has more than
            suburbs are because some suburbs may have important locations that can specify themselves.<br><br>

            For example - Parkville suburb contains postcodes below:<br>
            <ul>

          The information from two Melbourne Government websites shows that even the official known data source
          can refer to the same location differently. This might not have caused any problem because
          postal addresses use the postcode to locate actual locations, while suburbs are use unofficially to get
          a grasp of an area. However, these inconsistencies could cause some confusion to Melburnian when verbally communicate.
          We recommend that Government should consider this and improve by announcing the official definition of each area.
          Moreover, as some of us might aware Metropolitan council's responsible area should be included with this clarification.<br><br>

          To make our understanding simple and consistent across this report, we will use 12 suburbs. This was
          concluded by using data from Melbourne's official website as a base, which has 14 suburbs. The grouped
          'South Wharf-South Bank' and 'Kensington-Flemington' together, as these areas boundaries are not distinctly
          combined between 2 data sources.

        <p class="">
            Melbourne is a major city in Victoria state where people traverse both for work and pleasure.
            Although the city offers multiple ways of transmuting, Driving to the city is still preferable
            due to its convenience and flexibility. The chart on the right shows an overview of available
            parking space within the city. There are 1.2M Parking spaces available in total including public
            on-street parking spaces and registered off-street parking spaces.<br><br>

            Our initial observation shows that majorly parking spaces in Melbourne are offered as commercial
            off-streets parking spaces. Only 2% (24k) of overall parking spaces are very limited on-street parking
            that was allocated by the officials. This aligned with the drive to encourage travelers to commute using
            public transport. Drivers can opt. to pay for parking off-street as deem necessary.<br><br>

            Moreover, the city is pushing to become a smart city, on-street parking sensor has been set up across
            the city. However, only 20% (5k) of on-street parking spaces has been implemented to date. This shows as a very small proportional which you can see from heatmap below.

            Since we only have data from the on-street sensor, our further report regards parking habits
            will only be based on those collected pieces of information. In other words, we will focus on
            available data from 5k on-street parking sensors out of 24K on-street parking spaces. We assume
            that these are sampling is valid since the location of the sensors is spread out from across the city.

              We plotted a graph of parking sensors' occupancy at each time of the day by grouping them into each suburb. We can decide the interval of a display by adjusting the scale and toggle between counts and percentage. This allows us to see the respective ratio of parking space between the actual number of parking spaces occupied and the percentage of occupied spaces proportional to the number of sensors in that suburb.<br><br>

              On average, Carton South is the usual area that traveler parked their car despite the time of the day. This is because of the high number of available on-street parking spaces offer in that area. Moreover, if we look closely Carton South is usually crowded all day especially during the afternoon and evening time. While other parking areas only crowded during the afternoon.<br><br>

              In contrast, dockland has the lowest percentage of parking spaces occupied throughout the day. We can clearly see from heatmap below. This might lead to interesting insight on using dockland as an alternative parking spaces area if Carton South is full.

      <p class="fw-normal">
          In this section, the info we gather from sensors shows that most travelers chose to park in the northern area of the city like Carlton South, North Melbourne, or Parkville. The following question is, is this intentional? If not, why does traveler prefer to park only on the northern side of the city? Are travelers from the south drive passes the city just for parking?<br><br>

          We tried to answer this question by looking at the Infographic in section 1. We later realized that Melbourne municipality data nor suburb does not include an area of 'South Melbourne'. This leads to an incorrect and incomplete interpretation. From our common knowledge as Melbournian, the 'South Melbourne' area including 'Alber Park' is also a possible choice for parking. However, these areas are not within CBM free tram zone, thus, no free short transportation system available from those areas.<br><br>

          Combing these bits of knowledge, we highly suggest the government should include Parking offering options to the traveler from the south side of the city in their development plan. This is because if we can reduce traveler to drive pass through the city. It will save both drivers traveling time and city traffic usage. Therefore, we dare Government to include sensors in these areas to prove our assumption.<br><br>

      <p class=" fw-normal">
          In 2019, over 1.5M parking has been fined from the sensors. This is approximately 130k fines per month or 4k fines per day. This is a huge number of fines taken from drivers only for parking fees. If we display fines by suburbs, we can see that the number of proportional to the number of parking sensors in each area. Technically, we can presume that if the government set up more sensors to all the available on-street parking spaces. The number of fines will increase consequently. which means the government can gain more tax :(.<br><br>

          For the government, fines could mean that people are not following rules and should be punished. However, as a driver myself, I sometimes question if the rules are actually suited to real practice. To support my indictment, the above graph has shows that the fines happen with the same ratio throughout the year. Moreover, it is the same ratio in every single suburb. This shows that driver has a necessity to park even though they know that they might get fined. We would like to explore further into the area, however, current data gathering lacks information about the restriction on each bay. We advocate for government to take a look at the cause of this as allocating proper parking spaces to drivers should be part of city development plans.<br><br>

          Nevertheless, we acknowledge that from our first insight that plenty of off-street parking spaces are available. However, why do people keep choosing on-street parking over those? We could only assume that the price they charged for parking might be overpriced for the regular commuter. The government should also be responsible to ensure those parking spaces fees are reasonable to the people's cost of living.

          In summary, these insights are what we conclude from Melbourne Open data, thus, there are few points that we would like to highlight such as:
          <ul>
            <li>1. The city of Melbourne subarea boundaries are not consistent.</li>
            <li>2. The city of Melbourne has more off-street parking spaces than on-street parking spaces.</li>
            <li>3. There are a limited number of sensors that have been set up for on-street parking spaces.</li>
            <li>4. The northern part of the city is a popular area to find parking spaces.</li>
            <li>5. The southern part of the city parking area information is lacking.</li>
            <li>6. The number of fines is consistent across the year and area. Approximately 4k fines per day.</li>
          </ul>
          These insights are combined with the writer's personal opinion to gives some suggestions to the government.
